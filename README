It can only convert pbm images. By default the images to be converted have to
be present in ../data, so make sure the directory exists, and the image are
there. Contrary to what -help says, it doesn't take a second argument.
For instance, if you want to convert the test.pbm image present in the test
directory, you can do:

./doc_coder -p ./test test
This will generate a test.jb2 file.
